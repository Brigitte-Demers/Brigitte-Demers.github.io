    <p class = "border"> I was born in St. Albert, Alberta. When I was eight my family moved to the general Cornwall area, and to keep me from being annoying while we drove, my parents gave me my first game console and video game. Ever since that day I have loved video games and gaming! From sprawling JRPG's to fast paced action-shooters, I basically love any game that's well made. As I entered high school I joined all the tech courses and realized I love working with computers, and since I love video games I decided to start using some free game development software. Pretty quickly my mind was made up on what I was going to do in college. And now I'm here, pursuing my goal of creating video games!</p>

    <p id = "perone"> I'm just a gamaer who wants to make games herself someday. I love to draw, write and create little maps in software's like RPG Maker. I love using computers and coding, so I decided to go for the Game Programming course for St. Lawrence College. As I stated in my biography I have always loved video games! Most of my childhood was spent playing video games, not sports. And I want to share my passion for games with the world!  </p>
